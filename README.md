# SurveyBuddy
React.js webapp allowing for the creation and saving of surveys for use with Gaia and other feedback-hungry projects. Takes payments, and allows for authentication with Google OAuth. Implements the stripe and SendGrid API, web hooks to development and production servers , and the Materialize CSS Library. Sporadic edits to the application will be made into the future as I learn more things. 

Built as a result of enrolling in: https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/
